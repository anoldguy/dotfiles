# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for anoldguy. Requires `stow` to manage installation of dotfiles, and has lots of [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/)-specific stuff. The prompt is all [`starship`](https://starship.rs) tho!

2. Clone repo
3. `cd path/to/repo`

## Removal

## Terminal Themes

I've included a couple of my fav terminal themes. Flat has been my default for years, but both the Elementary and Dimmed Monokai look promising.
